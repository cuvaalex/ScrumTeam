Project Vision

Deliver a SaaS platform that helps Scrum teams work efficiently and
consistently, grounded in Jeff Sutherland's "Hyperproductive teams" work
and the PowerScrum Excel framework.

The platform will make proven Scrum practices simple to adopt, measure,
and improve. It will focus on clear visibility of work, faster feedback
loops, and continuous improvement across teams, roles, and portfolios.

Vision Principles

1. Evidence-based Scrum
   - Align workflows with the research and practices described by
     Jeff Sutherland.
   - Translate PowerScrum spreadsheet mechanics into guided, auditable
     product features.

2. Hyperproductive outcomes
   - Reduce friction in planning, tracking, and review.
   - Emphasize throughput, predictability, and quality.

3. Team-first experience
   - Serve Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and Developers with role-aware
     views and workflows.
   - Encourage transparency, collaboration, and accountability.

4. Integrations by default
   - Connect with existing platforms such as Azure DevOps and JIRA.
   - Reduce duplication by syncing work items, status, and metrics.

5. Continuous improvement
   - Make retrospectives actionable.
   - Provide metrics that drive learning, not vanity reporting.

Target users

- Scrum teams working in short iterations
- Scrum Masters leading multiple teams
- Product Owners managing roadmaps and value delivery
- Leaders seeking visibility without disrupting team autonomy

Outcome

Build the standard platform for running Scrum with discipline and speed,
so teams can deliver more value with less waste.
